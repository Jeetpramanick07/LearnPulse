🚀 LearnPulse – AI-Powered Student Risk Detection
An AI-driven early warning system that helps institutions detect and support at-risk students before failure happens.

🧩 Problem

Educational institutions struggle to identify academically at-risk students early.
Manual tracking is inefficient and reactive rather than proactive.

💡 Solution

LearnPulse is an AI-powered platform that predicts student academic risk levels and automatically triggers intervention alerts.

It enables early detection and proactive academic support.

🧠 How It Works

Student academic data (GPA, attendance, marks) is collected
A Machine Learning model (RandomForest) predicts risk level
Risk score (0–100) is generated
High-risk students automatically trigger email alerts
Admin dashboard shows analytics and high-risk students

🚀 What Makes It Unique

• Real-time risk prediction via API  
• Automated email alert system  
• Bulk risk recalculation for institutions  
• ML-integrated full-stack architecture
